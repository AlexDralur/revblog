* Main screen of the forum. User or visitors (they do not have to be logged) can see the categories.

#### *Post List screen:*

* Once the user/visitor clicks in one category, they are then redirected to all the posts inside that category. If the user is logged, the page shows the favourite posts first, from the newest to the last one.

#### *Game:*

* The game starts with three main parts: the hangman design (empty, because there is no mistakes yet), the random word hidden and the request for the user to guess a letter. Once the user guesses the first letter, two more items are added to the game: the used letters lists (so the user can see which letters they already guessed) and the amount of mistakes they made.

#### *Congratulations and Game Over:*

* There is two outcomes of the game: the user can either win or lose. If they win, they are greeted with a congratulations message and an invitation to play again. If the user loses, they receive a Game Over message, the information of what was the word and also the invitation to replay the game.

## **Future-Enhancements**

‚Äã

* Color could be added to the game to enhance the user experience.
* Store the game on a server so the game could be played online without a necessity of a terminal.

## **Bugs**

Problem üêû: Game continued even after six wrong guesses.

Causeüõ†: The input code was running twice within the while loop.

Resolution‚úÖ: Removed the unnecessary input call.
***

Problem üêû: If a incorrect key was used to chose the difficulty the game was rebooted.

Causeüõ†: The function being called was wrong.

Resolution‚úÖ: Change the structure of the function and the function being called.
***

Problem üêû: Start game function entering a loop without continuing the game.

Causeüõ†: The conditions for the while loop where not considered because of the logic applied.

Resolution‚úÖ: Change the condition from OR to AND.
***

Problem üêû: Endgame function was breaking the game.

Causeüõ†: Since the function is the base to the end, either winning or losing, another parameter was necessary to differentiate.

Resolution‚úÖ: A second parameter was added to run the function.
***

Problem üêû: Used letters list was being printed with brackets.

Causeüõ†: The print statement was not being called with the correct commands.

Resolution‚úÖ: Correct commands added.
***

## **Deployment**

I deployed the application on Heroku via the following procedure: -
‚Äã

1. Push the code to the Github [repository](https://github.com/AlexDralur/hangman-game-python).
2. Log in or sign up to Heroku where you need to create a new app.
3. Select a unique name.
4. In the settings tab reveal the config vars, for this project one had to be added per Code Institutes guidance.
5. For KEY, input PORT and for VALUE, input 8000 and click add.
6. Below that, click add buildpack, select Python and save.
7. Click add buildpack again, now select Nodejs and save.
8. Python should be above Nodejs on the buildpack list.
9. Go to deploy tab and for deployment method select GitHub and connect your GitHub account.
10. When prompted enter the repository you want to deploy, search and once found connect it.
11. Now you can either set it automatically or manually deploy the appropriate branch.
12. Automatically will deploy the app everytime you push something to GitHub.
13. Manually you have control over when the app should be deployed, but you have to remember to do it.
14. It might take a little while, but once the app is built Heroku will have a link to the live web page.

You can find the game live via the following URL - [live game](https://hangman-alexander-78ba1ad29a14.herokuapp.com/)
